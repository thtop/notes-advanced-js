# OOP vs FP

## Programming paradigm

- is writing code compliant with a specific set of rules.
- the advantage of each paradigm is simply in the modelling of your algorithm and data structures.
- The choice of which you use is simply what makes more sense for your project and the language that you're using.

## OOP

- organizing the code into units would be called Object Oriented Programming.
- An object is a box containing information and operations that are supposed to refer to the same concept or grouping it as an object.
- These pieces of information inside of the objects are called attributes or state and the operations that can happen on the state are known as methods.

## FP

- Avoiding side effects and writing pure functions would be called Functional Programming
- The code is essentially a combination of functions and data is immutable which leads to writing programs with no side effects and pure functions because in a function in a functional programming paradigm that function cannot change the outside world and the output value of a function simply depends on the given arguments.
- This allows functional programming to really have control over a program flow.

## OOP vs FP

- based on different concepts
- no one better than other
- They're simply different approaches to the same problem.

- **FP**

  - First class citizens
  - Higher-Order Functions
  - Pure Functions
  - Referentail transparency

  - Pillars

    - Pure functions
    - Composing function

  - Haskell
  - Closure

  - Functional style
    - function manipulate data structures like trees and arrays and objects and things like composition are used a lot more than loops and iterations and if else statements that are more procedural.

- **OOP**

  - objects are first class citizens

  - Pillars

    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism

  - C#, Python, Java

## Goal

- Clear + Understandable
- Easy to Extend
- Easy to Maintain
- Memory Efficient
- DRY

## JavaScript

- Both OOP & FP
- You can pick the solution to your own problem.
