# OOP vs FP 2

## FP

- many different operation for which the data is fiexed.
- stateless
- pure
- declerative
- good
  - large data for applications
  - few things that require a lot of operations a lot of little functions applied to it well then FP is usually a good idea.

## OOP

- few operations on common data
- statefull
- side effect
- imperative
- good
  - many things like characters in a game with not too many operations.

## Both

- React
  - Component => Inheritance
  - JSX => Pure Function without state

## All programs

- primary components

  - data
  - behaviors

- OOP => data + behaviors = class => object
- FP => data and behavior are distinctly different things and should be kept separate for clarity
