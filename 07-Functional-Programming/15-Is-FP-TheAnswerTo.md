# Is FP The Answer To Everything?

- the idea with functional programming is this idea of separation of data and functions or data and the effects that happen on that data.

- keeping functions small and pure and composed while doing one thing at a time and doing it well

- this idea of immutability the idea that functions that take inputs and return outputs so that it can be used with other functions it allows us to have a predictable program where it minimizes bugs because everything is so simple

- and as long as we are able to combine these small little functions together we're able to create really
