- keeping functions small and pure and composed while doing one thing at a time and doing it well

- Immutability the idea that functions that take inputs and return outputs so that it can be used with other functions it allows us to have a predictable program where it minimizes bugs because everything is so simple

- To combine these small little functions together we're able to create really complex programs.
