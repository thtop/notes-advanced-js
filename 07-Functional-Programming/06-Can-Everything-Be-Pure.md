# Can Everything Be Pure?

- No site effects
- The same input -> same output

- The goal of functional programming is not to make everything pure functions.
- The goal is to minimize side effects.

- Purity is more of a confidence level.
- It cannot be 100 precent.

> We want to build programs that are built with a bunch of very small very reusable predictable pure functions.

## Perfect function

1. 1 Task
2. return statement
3. Pure
4. No shared state
5. Immutable State
6. Composable
7. Predictable

> Functional Programming at the end of the day is just about making your code predictable.
