# Join Our Online Classroom

To make sure that you all succeed with this course, we have an online community of thousands of developers helping to answer questions and talk about all things programming just like a bootcamp. Some people even use this community after they have finished the course and gotten jobs since they now have lifelong coding friends.

A lot of companies use Discord to communicate across teams and is a valuable tool for you to learn as you become a javascript expert. In the spirit of keeping the course as useful as possible for employment, we are introducing a Discord online classroom where you can:

- Introduce yourself
- Ask the community coding questions
- Get help with exercises
- Meet other students around the world
- Learn how to answer interview questions
- Learn from each other

I am very excited about this and many students have said this is the best part of the course as you will feel like you are learning in a classroom rather than by yourself in front of a computer. I know it isn't for everybody, but being able to ask questions and help others when they have questions is the best way to learn. The Discord community should give you faster replies to your questions from the community, while learning another valuable tool of a programmer.

I hope you find it useful. To join the group, go to this link here. Once there, you can click on channels to explore different topics.

I'll see you inside :)
