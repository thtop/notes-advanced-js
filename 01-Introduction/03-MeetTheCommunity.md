# Exercise: Meet The Community!

Before we get started, let's do a quick exercise that won't take you more than 5 minutes.

1. Please introduce yourself in the community Discord (Invite Link in the previous lesson) group in the #introductions channel to get familiar with how it works! If you don't have Discord, please go to the previous lecture to see how to get it. Quickly share who you are, where you are from, and why you chose to do this course. Doing this course yourself is completely fine, but it is always good to have a community of others, similar to you, helping you when you need motivation, and sharing in the joy when you succeed.

2. Go to the #programming-buddies. I want everyone here to find a partner to work with. We all need a programming buddy, so that is what we'll be doing today, finding programming buddies! You will be keeping each other accountable throughout the course and motivating each other to finish. I know it may sound silly, but this is the biggest factor in completing the course. Who knows, maybe you will find life long friends / coworkers this way.

3. Our community is growing and Discord has a lot of discussions. Check out different channels and especially for this course: #js, and #interview-questions. Finally the #recapoftheday and #announcements help you stay up to date with this Discord community. As our community grows it will be difficult to keep up with all the channels. #recapoftheday will only be one or two posts a day only by myself or a few of the administrators with important messages that you may have missed from Discord. This way you can always make sure you are up to date with what's happening.

Some of the channels available for you to join:

- job-hunting - For all questions related to getting a job as a programmer

- dev-resources - Myself and others share interesting articles and tools we find. Great way to stay up to date in the industry

- alumni - Ask graduates of this course questions

- womenintech - For the female coders out there

- interview-questions - Where we practice interview questions together

....and many many more!

Trust me, the Discord community is an invaluable part of this course (some would say, it is the best part of this course!). You can also follow me on twitter where I keep you updated about industry news, upcoming courses, and send announcement about coding challenges we run monthly: @andreineagoie
